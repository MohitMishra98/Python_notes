in the reading and writing in a .txt file 
there are pointers
reading and writing is affected due to location of pointer
location of pointer is the location where reading and writing occured most recently
reading and writing will occured from the location of pointer
if the pointer is located at the mid of file
then reading file will only output the data after that pointer
