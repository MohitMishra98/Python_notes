#This file is for variables

#Variables are a thing that contains a value and that value can be changed
#Variables are used to store data in the memory

#python is a implicitly typed language
#this means that you do not have to declare the type of a variable
#python automatically assigns the data type to the variable
#e.g x = 5
#and not int x = 5

#DATA TYPES
#integer
#this can be a positive or negative or 0 integer
#e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

#string
#this is a sequence of characters
#e.g. "John", "Doe", "Hello World"
#methods to make a string
#1. single quotes 'hello'
#2. double quotes "hello"
#3. triple quotes '''hello'''

#float
#this is a number with a decimal point
#it is same as integer but with a decimal point
#e.g. 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5

#boolean
#this is a data type that has only two possible values
#True or False
#e.g. True, False

#To create a variable, you need to give it a name and assign it a value
name = "John"
age = 25
price = 25.50

#To print the value of a variable
print(name)
print(age)
print(price)

#To check the type of a variable
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(price))
